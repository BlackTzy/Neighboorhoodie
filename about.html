                      A hoodie is a sweatshirt with a hood. Hoodies with zippers usually include two pockets on the lower front, one on either side of the zipper, while "pullover" hoodies often include a single large muff or pocket in the same location. Both styles include a drawstring to adjust the hood opening. When worn up, the hood covers most of the head and neck and sometimes the face. Hoodies may be worn for aesthetic purposes, or protection against the environment (cold weather, rain, etc.)</a>
